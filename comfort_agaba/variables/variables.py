# Python Variables

# Variables are stores of value
# We use the = to create a variable

age = 17
name = 'Agaba'

print(name, age)

# Some rules to consider
# spaces are not allowed
# variables cannot start with a number
# special characters are not allowed
# variables names are case sensitive

# Recommendations
name = "agaba"
agaba_age = 17
my_movie_character = "Peter Griffin" # snake case
myMovieCharacter = "Stewie Griffin" # camel case
MyMovieCharacter = "Supersonic" # pascal case
