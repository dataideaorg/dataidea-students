    "6) When the data to be stored in the tuple is \"read-only\" and should not be altered. For example, id numbers.\n",

    "7) A set is a collection of unique items while a dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, with unique keys. A set can be used to store unique elements, whose order does not matter, while a dictionary can be used to store various pieces of information related to a particular key.\n",
    "\n",
    "8) Advantages of using lists over sets: Ordered, so the elements can be accessed using indicies. Since a set is unordered, it is not possible to access elements using indicies. This means that sets are also not ideal for sorting data. Disadvantages of lists compared to sets: Lists are slower than sets due to being ordered and mutable. Also, sets only allow uique values, hence can remove duplicates from large datasets, which lists cannot do.\n",
    "\n",
    "9) A list might need to be converted into a dictionary if we have multiple lists describing characteristics of a small group of people: for example, characteristics of students in a class. A dictionary is ideal if the same characteristics are available for every student, and if evert student has a unique identifier (key), e.g student number.\n",
    "\n",
    "10) One example is the use of a list to store results from a function: since lists allow duplicate elements, they are handy for storing results that may need to be visualised, whereas a set would eliminate duplicate values, making comparison impossible."
