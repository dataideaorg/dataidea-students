# rounding off floating point numbers
# round(number, ndigits)
# ndigits is optional, default is 0
# Example
x = round(1.5)

# Example
pi = 3.141592653589793
rounded_pi = round(pi, 3)


# raising a number to a power
# pow(base, exponent) 
# Example
x = pow(2, 3)


# Get the absolute value of a number
# abs(number)
# Example
x = abs(-4.5)
print(x)

# Getting a quotient and remainder
# divmod(x, y)
# returns (quotient, remainder)
# Example
x = divmod(10, 3)
