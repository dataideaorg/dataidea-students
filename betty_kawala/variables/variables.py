# A variable is a store of value

number = 7
name = 'Shafara'
country = 'Uganda'

# Rules for naming variables
# 1. A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# 2. A variable name cannot start with a number
# 3. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# 4. Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
# 5. The reserved words (keywords) cannot be used as variable names

# Examples of valid variable names
my_name = 'Betty' # snake case
myName = 'Betty' # camel case
MyName = 'Betty' # pascal case

print(name, country, number)
