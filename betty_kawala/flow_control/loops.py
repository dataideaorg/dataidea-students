# Loops are used to repeatitively execute a block of code.

# In python there are two types of loops:
# 1. while loop
# 2. for loop

# For loop
# The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence 
# uch as a list, tuple, or string.

# Example

countries = ["India", "USA", "UK", "Canada"]

# for country in countries:
#     print(country)

# for letter in countries[0]:
#     print(letter)

# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# summ = 0
# for number in numbers:
#     summ += number

# print(summ)
for number in range(1, 10):
    print(number)

# Homework
# - nested for loop
# - while loop
# - break and continue
# - pass
