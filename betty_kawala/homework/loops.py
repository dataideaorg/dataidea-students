# Nested for loop
# A nested for loop is used to repeat a certain block of code multiple times.
# The outer loop controls the number of times the inner loop runs
# for number1 in range(3):
#     for number2 in range(3):
#         print("number1=" + str(number1) + ", number2=" + str(number2))

# While loop
# A while loop repeats a block of code until a certain condition is met
