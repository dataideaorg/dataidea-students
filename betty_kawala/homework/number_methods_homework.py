# How to round off to the nearest integer
# To round off we can use round(number, number of decimal places)
# For example
x = 5.429176
rounded_x = round(x,2)
print(rounded_x)

# How to get the absolute value of a number
# To get the absolute value we use abs(number)
# for example
y = abs(-3)
print(y)

# How to get the quotient and remainder of a division
# We use divmod(numerator,divisor) and it returns (quotient,remainder)
# For example
x = divmod(15,4)
print(x)

# How to find the square root of a number
# We can use **
# For example
w = 25
x = w ** 0.5

# or

y = 25
z = pow(y, 0.5)
