# Membership operators are used to test if a value or variable 
# is found in a sequence of values.

# There are two membership operators:

# Operator            Name
# in                  Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object
# not in              Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object

# Example
text = 'I love to code in Python'
is_python_in_text = 'Python' not in text

names = ['Kawala', 'Betty', 'Juma', 'Shafara']

print('John' in names)
