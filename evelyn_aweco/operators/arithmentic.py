# Arithmetic Operators
# These perform mathematical operations on numerical operands

# Name          Description
# +              Addition
# -             Subtraction
# *             Multiplication
# /            Division
# **          Exponentiation
# %          Remaider (modulus)
# //         Floor Division



# Example
x = 7
y = 3

summation = x + y
difference = x - y
product = x * y
quotient = x / y

# more operators
eponent = x ** y
remainder = x % y
floor = x // y
